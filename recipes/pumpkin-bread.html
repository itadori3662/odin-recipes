        <h3><em>What're We Making?</em></h3>
        <p>This is the recipe for pumpkin bread that my Grandma used to make.<br><br>This bread is very moist, sweet, and almost cake-like in texture. One of my all-time favorite fall treats.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>3 Cups of Sugar</li>
                <li>1 Cup of Oil</li>
                <li>4 Eggs</li>
                <li>1 tsp of Nutmeg</li>
                <li>1 tsp of Cinnamon</li>
                <li>1 tsp of Baking <strong>*Soda*</strong></li>
                <li>1 1/2 tsp of Salt</li>
                <li>2 Cups of Canned Pumpkin</li>
                <li>2/3 Cup of Water</li>
                <li>3 Cups of Flour</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp of Baking <strong>*Powder*</strong></li>
            </ul>
                <br>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease your desired pans, with either butter or shortening, and set aside.</li>
                  <ul>
                      <li>Don't use aerosol pan lube, it will cause the bread to stick to the pan (no bueno).</li>
                  </ul>
                <li>Combine the sugar, oil, eggs, nutmeg, cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl. Beat well.</li>
                <li>Add the remaining ingredients and mix until well combined.</li>
                <li>Pour the batter into your prepared pans, and bake at 350 for an hour (if you are making big loaves). Your bread is done when you can put a fork in the middle and it comes out clean.</li>
                <li>Allow bread to cool for 15 minutes in the pan, then transfer on a rack to finish cooling</li>
                <li>Serve with your toppings of choice! Enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
