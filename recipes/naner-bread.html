        <h3><em>What're We Making?</em></h3>
        <p>This is the recipe for Banana Bread that my just happens to be one of my mother's most sought after recipes. <br><br>I personally cannot stand this bread, but that is a personal preference and in no way related to quality. I have heard that in the Banana Bread circles, this is one of the better recipes.</p>
